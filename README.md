 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Sebastian's Coding Journey</h3></summary>

I embarked on my coding journey back in 2021, stepping into my very first Computer Science class with a curious mind and a blank slate. At that point, lines of code were mysterious strings of characters that held immense potential yet seemed entirely foreign.

Fast forward two years, and the transformation has been remarkable. What began as a novice's exploration has evolved into a passionate pursuit of software craftsmanship. I find myself currently immersed in an exciting role as a Software Engineering Intern, contributing my skills and knowledge to real-world projects at [Company Name].

My journey into the world of code has been a journey of self-discovery and growth. I've come to adore the intricacies of programming languages, the thrill of solving complex problems, and the satisfaction that comes with turning ideas into functional code.

Beyond coding, my interests orbit around all things tech-related. I'm captivated by the constantly evolving landscape of technology, enjoy gaming as a creative escape, and derive immense joy from tackling challenges, both in the digital realm and beyond.

Looking ahead, my sights are set on continuing this exhilarating journey. With plans to transition into a full-time role after graduation, I'm eager to expand my knowledge, contribute meaningfully to innovative projects, and be a part of shaping the ever-evolving world of technology.
