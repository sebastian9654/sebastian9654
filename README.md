<summary><h3>👨‍💻 Sebastian's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    I embarked on my coding journey back in 2021, stepping into my very first Computer Science class with a curious mind and a blank slate. At that point, lines of code were mysterious strings of characters that held immense potential yet seemed entirely foreign.

Fast forward two years, and the transformation has been remarkable. What began as an exploration has evolved into a passionate pursuit of software development. I find myself currently working in an exciting role as a Software Engineering Intern, contributing my skills and knowledge to real-world projects at [ICE].

Beyond coding, my interests are all things tech-related and the constantly evolving landscape of technology, enjoy gaming as a creative escape, and love tackling challenges, both in the digital and beyond.
